## Overview

The Clipboard Landing Page is a demonstration of my skills in building a responsive and dynamic web page using React, a powerful JavaScript library. The project leverages Vite as the development tool to enhance the overall performance and development experience.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
